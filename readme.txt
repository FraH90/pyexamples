Info:

- examples are divided by categories
- every category folder can contain python files (in that case they are intendeed to be run as standalone scripts, that is the execution relies just on the scrits itself and system libraries) or subfolders that contain projects; in that case the entry point script will be the one with the same name of the subfolder
